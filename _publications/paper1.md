title: "Replicable Benchmarking of Neural Machine Translation for Low-Resource Local Languages in Indonesia"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/replicableNMT
excerpt: 'Benchmarking potential breakthroughs became a challenge due to the high-resource settings many models utilize. However, using weak baselines are not a convincing way in showing the impact of a breakthrough. So, we created a replicable benchmarking of NMT for low-resource local languages in Indonesia made using only one GPU and utilizing only 96 hours per model.'

Benchmarking potential breakthroughs became a challenge due to the high-resource settings many models utilize. However, using weak baselines are not a convincing way in showing the impact of a breakthrough. So, we created a replicable benchmarking of NMT for low-resource local languages in Indonesia made using only one GPU and utilizing only 96 hours per model.
